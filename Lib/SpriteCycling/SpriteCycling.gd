"""
	Sprite Cycling turns all children within the parent node
	to draw sprites in forward order one frame and
	backward order the next when two sprites are
	overlapping each other.

	 USE CASES:
	   There are two items with similiar image size
	   that are overlapping at the same spot, which
	   makes either item A or B can barely be seen.
	   How about if we swap both item A and B
	   cycling back and forth so some part of their
	   sprites can be seen? Wouldn't be that great
	   to not confusing player with item A is
	   being hidden by item B? This is called
	   'Faking Transparency'.
	
	 USAGE: Can be used anywhere. Place it within the parent node.
	 Example:
	
	 Root
	 ┖╴Node2D
	   ┠╴Iterable
	   ┠╴Sprite          <- Affects by iterable.
	   ┠╴Kinematic2d     <- Affects by iterable.
	   ┠╴Label           <- No effect.
	   ┖╴Node2D          <- Affects by iterable.  
		 ┠╴Label          <- No effect, but affected to parent.
		 ┖╴Sprite         <- No effect, but affected to parent.
