# Godot -​ My Library Helpers

This project contains library helper scene files for various use cases for [Godot Engine](godotengine.org​). Its main use is to help make the game development progress more faster.

## Setting up libraries for use in your project

You can directly copy **/Lib** folder and put them in your project. After its sub-folders are integrated with Godot, you can rename or move the main folder anywhere so that Godot will automatically rescan the files.

## Available Libraries

**AudioManager** - A singleton audio player that plays background music and sound effects. The main advantage is to provide an easier way to play audio from anywhere without having to attach sound effect to a node.

**SpriteCycling** - Allows drawing sprites in forward order one frame and backward order the next. This library is inspired by video games like Mega Man for Nintendo Entertainment System.

**BulletBehavior** -​ The Bullet behavior simply moves parent object forwards at an angle. However, it provides extra options like gravity and angle in degrees that allow it to also be used. Like the name suggests it is ideal for projectiles like bullets, but it is also useful for automatically controlling other types of objects like enemies which move forwards continuously.
